The Developer Code Snippet tool is one that is made to store frequently used functions and code snippers which you have created.

Features:
- Code Snippet storage
- Conversion between coding languages
- Authentication

How Does it work?
A user creates an account and that account allows the user to store code snippets that they have created/used. Furthermore there will be an option 
to change the language which it is coded in using AI to adjust the syntax appropriately.
